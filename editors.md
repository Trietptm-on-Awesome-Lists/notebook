## [VIM](https://www.vim.org)

The first time I heard about VIM I thought "Who do fuck wants to use that??? Wait! What? [How to quit this thing??](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-to-exit-the-vim-editor)". Soon I realized how genius this peace of software is. God bless the authors of this editor. If you are a serious programmer, go learn VIM. If you love Linux, go learn VIM. If you love Open Source, go learn VIM. Period.

There is a lot of going out there about VIM, just google for it & you'll find plugins, themes, distributions & [more](https://vimawesome.com/).

### [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/)

A modern, community-driven modular vim distribution, which contains a lot of built-in features (which you can setup with VIM alone, too). For me it is the counterpart to [Spacemacs](#spacemacs).

### [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)

Literally the future of VIM, because these guys fixed some issues some users have with VIM (or something like that...I got bored after the second sentence). And I tried it and removed it afterwards and stuck to VIM, because I don't need more VIM. Sometimes less is more.

## Emacs

### Spacemacs

After configuring my VIM and getting used to it and having some fun with it for nearly a year, I wanted to try something new, something different (kind of) and I found my true love. *Spacemacs*. This community-driven Emacs distribution is so fucking good. It feels fast (doesn't heat up by CPU), light (doesn't eat up too much RAM), beautiful (looks really nice by default) and supports a lot of features (which are built-in). VIM users are welcome too. Install it and you will see why.

## Microsoft

### Visual Studio Code

Since I discovered [Flutter](https://flutter.io) & the support for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org) on [Spacemacs](#spacemacs) is not as good is it should I tried to the code editor from Microsoft. I also installed the recommended plugin described on the Flutter homepage. You know what? It is really fun to work with this editor. I'm really happy with it, because it just works.

## [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)

I read about this guys while playing around with Android development. These are the makers of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). I thought, well if Google thinks this guys make good editors than I have to try all products of the company.
This guys are making really good editors, but for me it is too overblown. I as a programmer just want to launch up my editor and start coding. No whistles, no fancy stuff, no distructing update notifications. I installed all 5 editors listed below. Tried all of them, just out of curiosity. I didn't like them at all. Each of them eats to much RAM and heats up the CPU, because the editors are full with a lot of features & you need a [JRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine#Execution_environment) to run them. Did I mention that I hate Java?

### [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Full blown editor. With this one you don't need to install all the editors listed below. You may just install the required plugins to set up your editor and customize to your needs.

### [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm)

Editor for Web developers with HTML, CSS & JavaScript support out of the box.

### [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm)

You are coding with PHP? Then try this one.

### [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)

They got one for Python, too.

### [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby)

Oh! And don't foget about Ruby.

## [Atom](https://atom.io)

I tried this one in the early days and it was kind of new & shiny & cool. Soon after installing all the essential plugins I needed to do my homework (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, Ruby, ...) I realized that this editor is damn slow on my machine. Atom also was running up my CPU to 100%, which was really annoying. So drop it from my machine & switched to [Spacemacs](#spacemacs).

## Sublime Text

Everybody was talking about this editor. How great & fast & extensible it is.

## Eclipse

I used this one in my early days as a Java developer and while studying informatics. This editor is really good, if you are a Java developer. It just works out of the box & you may install some plugins (e.g. GIT support, FindBugs, ...) and start coding right away. You may set up a bunch of things, if you want to. Or develop a plugin (which I did for work) and/or a standalone application (which I did also) based on the Eclipse RCP. There are good tutorials out there, but I recommend you the blog of this guy: [Vogella](http://www.vogella.com).

## NetBeans

Never truely tried this one out. So nothing to report here.
